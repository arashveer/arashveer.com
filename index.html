                    I am Arashveer Garaya, currently studying Computer Science at University of British Columbia. I enjoy working on new ideas while actively incorporating new concepts to develop better solutions for problems. I take pleasure in working as a part of a team, and my teammates would describe me as driven, enthusiastic, and someone to goes out of their way to understand a problem thoroughly and find a relevant solution. Currently, I am seeking opportunities where I can put my skills to develop valuable technologies that will benefit companies and their end-users.

                                Codebits is a tool that enables you to effortlessly write and share code with others using a simple link. I had this idea while collaborating on group projects during my classes, where we often resorted to screen sharing or sending code snippets before finalizing commits on Git. My aim was to create a solution that would streamline the code-sharing process. Through the development of this website, I gained hands-on experience in building a full-stack platform. This encompassed configuring a database and deploying a server, while also refining my front-end skills.

                                This project was undertaken as part of one of my courses, where the task was to develop a Java-based application. I chose to create an expense tracker due to its potential usefulness in my personal life. The implementation of this project utilized Java along with key libraries such as Java Swing for the user interface and JUnit for testing. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into essential software development paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming, the application of various design patterns, and the significance of ensuring data persistence using JSON.
